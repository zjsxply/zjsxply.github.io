# Linyue Pan Personal Website

This is Linyue Pan's personal academic website based on [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

## Domain

The site is configured as a GitHub Pages user site:

```yaml
url: https://zjsxply.github.io
baseurl:
```

The repository should be named `zjsxply.github.io`. The deployment workflow builds the site from `main` and publishes the generated `_site` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>.
